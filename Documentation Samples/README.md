## Title: Creating a simple GUI application using Python

The purpose of this file is to explain step-by-step how create a simple GUI application using Python from scratch. 

## Software Requirements
Python 3+

## Install libraries
The following two libraries are needed to be able to run GUI on python and access images. 

Tkinter and PIL (Python imaging library)

To install, in the terminal type:
sudo pip install pil
sudo pip install tkinter

Tkinter is a GUI (Graphical user interface) widget set for Python to be able to create a more innovative application. 

Tkinter is not the only GuiProgramming toolkit for Python. It is however the most commonly used.

## Step 3 - Controlling the button

The main purpose of any button is to actually do something when it is pressed. This is called an event. In the following example, when the user presses the submit button, the code will call the function xxx and information about the user will be displayed
