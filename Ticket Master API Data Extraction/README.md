# Project Title

Utilizing the Ticketmaster API with a Python Script

## Getting Started

1. Created an account to be able to retrieve the API key from the ticketmaster url via https://developer-acct.ticketmaster.com/user/login

2. Retrieve the api code to be able to extract the necessary data from Ticket Master


### Prerequisites

- On python install the following libraries:
    1. csv
    2. ticketpy
    3. json
    4. requests

### Installing

- Run ticketMasterScript.py on Python 3+

After running the script the output will be displayed in the console (this was done for quick testing purposes) and in a CSV file.



## Bugs
1. Date is not in the future - it is todays date
2. During this task I was refering to data model (on github data-model-ticketMaster) for the table details but the name was not always being accepted.
3. the csv does not reflect the requested outcome of this task
4. the outcome is being listed in just one column, need to extract the exact value and separate under different headings
